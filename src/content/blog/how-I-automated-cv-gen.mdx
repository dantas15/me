I'm in the moment in my life where I'm trying to automate stuff that I consider boring. Recently I just automated the creation of my resumÃ© [on my website](https://dantas15.com/cv.pdf).

## The Problem

For some time I would just download my [LinkedIn profile as `.pdf`](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a541960/como-salvar-um-perfil-em-um-formato-pdf?lang=en-US) and apply. But I had some issues that really bothered me, like the skills displays messing up everytime I changed something on my profile and that feeling that recruiters might think I'm being too careless to use a generic tool to generate my CV. 

Then I tried improving things: I started using a [template on Figma](https://www.figma.com/community/file/1296192470925545513/curriculum-vitae).

I must confess I was really satisfied with the design, but with the work I had when I had to change the information was not worth it. Besides, the PDF exported by Figma was so big I always had to compress it before using it.

So I decided I would build my own, but without having to worry about clicking layers or external tools.

## The Solution

### How to generate the PDF

I did some search and found out a good tool to generate a PDF server side: [puppeteer](https://pptr.dev/). And I chose [handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) to generate the HTML since I already knew how to use it before (as I write this, I'm looking for [other alternatives](https://docs.astro.build/en/reference/container-reference/#rendertostring), but haven't implemented yet, [ping me](/contact) if you would like to help)

### Astro

Ok, but how to do it using [astro](https://astro.build) (the tool I use for my blog)?

Well, for that, I [static file endpoint](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/endpoints/#static-file-endpoints) that would be responsible for fetching/generating the PDF at build time (so I don't have to manually build it).

In [`cv.pdf.ts`](https://github.com/dantas15/me/blob/main/src/pages/cv.pdf.ts):

```ts
import { readFileSync } from 'node:fs';

import handlebars from 'handlebars';
import { DateTime } from 'luxon';

import { personalData } from '../data/personal';

import type { APIRoute } from 'astro';


export const GET: APIRoute = async () => {

  const htmlTemplate = readFileSync('src/hbs/cv-template.hbs', 'utf8');
  // Generating the HTML
  const template = handlebars.compile(htmlTemplate);
  const html = template(personalData);

  // Connecting to puppeteer in order to create the PDF
  const browser = await puppeteer.launch({
    args: ['--no-sandbox', '--disable-setuid-sandbox'],
  });
  const page = await browser.newPage();
  await page.setContent(html);
  const pdf = await page.pdf({ format: 'a4' });
  await browser.close();
  return new Response(pdf, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/pdf' } });
};
```

The code above works wonders on development! 

## Time to ship - another problem

As soon as pushed my changes that triggered vercel build, I realized that the build failed since chromium could not be installed (puppeteer runs a version of it).

Turns out vercel had limitations with the free plan I'm using, so I couldn't use puppeteer.

## Another Solution

In order to fix that, I decided to create my own API that renders the PDF for me, it's a small project I created just for it, it's [open sourced](https://github.com/dantas15/pptr-html2pdf).

Then, going back to my blog code, I created a function to fetch the PDF from the generated HTML:

```ts
type PDFResponse = {
    pdf: string;
};

async function fetchPdf(html: string): Promise<Buffer> {
    const response = await fetch(import.meta.env.PDF_ENDPOINT, {
        headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json', authorization: import.meta.env.PDF_GEN_API_KEY },
        method: 'POST',
        body: JSON.stringify({ html })
    });

    if (!response.ok) {
        throw new Error(`PDF Api not working: ${(await response.json()).error}`);
    }
    const data: PDFResponse = await response.json();

    return Buffer.from(data.pdf, 'utf-8');
}
```

Then I fixed the `GET` route:

```ts
export const GET: APIRoute = async () => {
    const templateHtml = readFileSync('src/hbs/cv-template.hbs', 'utf8');
    const template = handlebars.compile(templateHtml);
    const html = template(personalData);
    const pdf = await fetchPdf(html);

    return new Response(pdf, { headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/pdf' } });
};
```

There you go! Here's how the CV is generated (you can also see it on [dantas15.com/cv.pdf](https://dantas15.com/cv.pdf)):
