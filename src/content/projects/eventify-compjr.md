**Project Overview:** This is a Full Stack CRUD app that enables users to sign-in with google to see new events or share them. I made it as a trainee so I could become a member at [Comp Júnior](https://compjunior.com.br/)

## Features

1. **Google Authentication**
2. **Events CRUD**

## Techs

## Outcome

I was able to finish the whole authentication process and the CRUD, as well as some Docker files to enable testing locally. I became a member at Comp Júnior after this.
